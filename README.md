# NodeMCU_IoT_BME280
Iot Project with NodeMCU with ESP8266 Wife, Bosch BME280 environmental sensore and I2C Rentaly LCD 1602. Data is uploaded to ThingSpeak

I did this project to learn more about the BME280 and bring my first IoT starter project alive by using the cheap and powerfull NodeMCU. The code has some additional lines for the LCD display, which are not required. However, they make the visualition look nicer and more user friendly. 

I added a lot of comments. As I am not a coder and doing this just as a hobby for fun, they I do not claim them to be pro-level and fully correct, but they should be understandable.
